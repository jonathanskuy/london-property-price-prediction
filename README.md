# London Property Price Prediction System
An AI-powered property price predictor that accurately predicts house prices in London, accounting for many factors including but not limited to school quality, transport accessibility and local crime rates.

## Overview
This project proposes the development of a machine learning-based system designed to predict property prices within a local area. The system utilises supervised learning techniques to analyse historical housing data and identify relationships between property prices and key influencing factors.

The model takes multiple input variables, including the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, distance to the city centre, school ratings, crime rates, and public transport accessibility. These variables were selected as they represent both structural and environmental factors that significantly impact property values.

The output of the system is a predicted property price, allowing users to obtain more accurate and data-driven estimates compared to traditional methods. By leveraging machine learning, the system is able to capture complex patterns in the data and improve prediction accuracy.

## Problem Statement
One of the key challenges in the housing market is the difficulty in determining accurate property prices at a local level. Prices are influenced by a combination of factors such as neighbourhood quality, access to public transport, school performance, and crime rates.

Existing estimation methods are often slow, generic, and lack the ability to incorporate multiple influencing variables simultaneously. This creates a gap for a more efficient and accurate system that can provide realistic property price predictions based on real-world data.

Therefore, there is a need for a data-driven solution that can analyse multiple factors and generate reliable property price estimates tailored to specific locations.

## Demo
A user-friendly demo notebook ("app/property_price_prediction.ipynb") is provided to simulate the real-world implementation of this system.

To obtain predicted property price, the user can input:
- Postcode
- Bedroom/Bathroom/Living Room Count
- Floor Area (in sqm)
- Property Type
- Tenure (Leasehold/Freehold)
- Energy Rating (A-G)

After filling all input fields and clicking the "Predict" button, the system will generate and display the predicted property price based on its details provided by the user.

## Limitations
Even though the model has proven itself highly effective, there are some limitations. Firstly, the model depends heavily on data accuracy; for instance, any incomplete data can distort the results. The second drawback of the model is that there are some variables present in reality but not in the model, including the state of the property, market changes, and economic tendencies. Moreover, it is worth noting that the accuracy of the model declines when dealing with high-priced properties.

There are many ways that the existing model can be improved. First, by adding other datasets like economic indicators or even data about the conditions of the property being sold. Second, the model can be refined through better feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Third, experimenting with new algorithms or even building an ensemble might yield better results as well as a real-world application of the algorithm.
